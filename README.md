## Built With
1. [Get](https://pub.dev/packages/get) - Navigation: A consistent navigation library that lets you navigate between screens, open dialogs/bottomSheets, and display snackbars from anywhere in your code without context.
2. [Mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx) - State management: A state-management library that makes it simple to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI.
3. [Flutter_modular](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular) - Modular gives us a structure that allows us to manage dependency injection and routes in just one file per module, so we can organize our files with that in mind.
4. [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) - The Google Firebase Authentication
5. [Firebase Cloud](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions) - The Firebase Cloud
<!-- 1. [Get_It](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) - Dependency injection: A simple Service Locator for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies highly inspired by Splat. One of the strongest point of this libray is taht it does not need the **context** to work; hence, it can be used in anywhere in the application. -->
